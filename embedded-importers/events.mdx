## Listening to Events

Use events to react to user actions and import lifecycle updates.

```jsx
import { useFilefeedEvent } from "@filefeed/react";

useFilefeedEvent("workbook:complete", (event) => {
  console.log("Import completed:", event);
});

useFilefeedEvent("step:change", (event) => {
  console.log("Step changed:", event.step);
});
```

## Programmatic Control

```jsx
import { useFilefeed } from "@filefeed/react";

const { openPortal, closePortal } = useFilefeed();
```

<Note>
Events are ideal for analytics, progress tracking, and in-UI data processing.
