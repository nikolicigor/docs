## What are Automated Flows?

Automated Flows allow you to set up file processing workflows that run automatically without manual intervention. Files are processed based on triggers like file uploads, scheduled intervals, or external system events.

## Key Benefits

## How it Works

1. **Configure the Flow** - Set up your processing rules and triggers
2. **Define Input Sources** - Specify where files come from (SFTP, API, etc.)
3. **Set Processing Rules** - Define how files should be processed
4. **Configure Outputs** - Specify where processed data should go
5. **Monitor & Manage** - Track processing status and manage flows

## Supported Integrations

- **SFTP** - Secure file transfer protocol
- **FTP** - Coming soon
- **API Endpoints** - Coming soon
- **Cloud Storage** - Coming soon
- **Email** - Coming soon
- **Webhooks** - Coming soon

## Flow Types

### Scheduled Flows
Process files at regular intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.)

### Event-driven Flows
Process files when specific events occur (file upload, API call, etc.)

### Continuous Flows
Monitor directories or endpoints continuously for new files

## Architecture

```
SFTP Upload (Client)
  → FileFeed SFTP
    → Pipeline (Schema + Mappings + Transforms)
      → Processing & Validation
        → Webhook Event (signed)
          → Your Webhook Endpoint
            → Fetch processed data via API/SDK
              → Persist to your DB
```

<Tip>
Respond quickly to webhooks and process asynchronously (queue/worker). Use the SDK to fetch full data pages.

### Checklist
- [ ] Create Client (SFTP credentials)
- [ ] Define Schema (fields & validation)
- [ ] Create Pipeline (mappings & transforms)
- [ ] Register Webhook (store secret, verify signature)
- [ ] Fetch processed data and persist
