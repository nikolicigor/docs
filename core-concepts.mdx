## Overview

FileFeed streamlines file-based integrations through two primary paths:

- **Embedded Importers**: In-app data import experiences (React SDK)
- **Automated Flows**: Backend/SFTP-driven automation with webhooks and API

## Compare at a glance

| Aspect | Embedded Importers | Automated Flows |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | User-initiated in-app | Scheduled or external (e.g., SFTP uploads) |
| Typical user | Product/Operations teams | Backend/Integrations teams |
| Data entry | UI mapping, preview, validate | File drop to SFTP or other source |
| Validation | In-app field + custom rules | Schema validation during processing |
| Processing | Client app | FileFeed pipelines + your backend via webhooks |
| Output | Records to your app | Webhook event + fetch processed data via API/SDK |
| Best for | Self-serve onboarding, ad-hoc imports | Continuous or automated partner feeds |

## Embedded Importers

### What it is
- In-app import experience powered by the React SDK
- Validates and transforms data client-side before sending

### When to use
- Product-led import UX inside your app
- One-off or occasional imports initiated by users

### How it works
1. Render the importer in your app
2. Map/validate fields and preview results
3. Submit to your backend to persist/process

## Automated Flows

### Building Blocks

### Clients
- Represents a data source (partner, vendor, tenant)
- Has dedicated SFTP space and credentials
- Isolated from other clients

### Schemas
- Define expected structure and validation rules
- Ensure incoming files conform to your target model

### Pipelines
- Connect a client to a schema
- Define mappings and optional transformations
- Create dedicated SFTP folders for uploads

### Pipeline Runs
- Each processed file creates a pipeline run
- Expose status, metadata, and processed data retrieval

### Webhooks
- Notify your system about pipeline events
- Sign payloads for security (HMAC)

<Note>
Use webhooks to trigger data syncs. Use the REST API/SDK to fetch full processed data.

## Next Steps

- **Frontend**: Start with the React SDK → `/embedded-importers/react-sdk`
- **Backend**: Configure the SFTP Flow → `/automated-flows/sftp-flow`
- **Programmatic**: Use the API Library → `/api-library/overview`
