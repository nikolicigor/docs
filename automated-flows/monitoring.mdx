## What to Monitor
- Pipeline run status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Webhook delivery success/failure
- Processing error messages and retry rates

## Best Practices
- Alert on sustained failures
- Keep idempotency keys to avoid duplicate processing
- Log event payloads with request IDs

<Note>
Use the API to list pipeline runs and webhook deliveries for analytics dashboards.
