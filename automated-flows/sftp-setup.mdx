## Clients

- Configure field mappings and transformations
- Creates SFTP folder for uploads

## Typical Workflow
1. Create client and credentials
2. Define schema (fields, types, validations)
3. Create pipeline (mappings, transformations)
4. Upload starter file (headers template)
5. Client uploads files to pipeline folder
6. FileFeed processes and emits webhook
