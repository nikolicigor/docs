## Overview

FileFeed streamlines file-based integrations through two primary paths:

- **Embedded Importers**: In-app data import experiences (React SDK)
- **Automated Flows**: Backend/SFTP-driven automation with webhooks and API

## Compare at a glance

| Aspect | Embedded Importers | Automated Flows |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | User-initiated in-app | Scheduled or external (e.g., SFTP uploads) |
| Typical user | Product/Operations teams | Backend/Integrations teams |
| Data entry | UI mapping, preview, validate | File drop to SFTP or other source |
| Validation | In-app field + custom rules | Schema validation during processing |
| Processing | Client app | FileFeed pipelines + your backend via webhooks |
| Output | Records to your app | Webhook event + fetch processed data via API/SDK |
| Best for | Self-serve onboarding, ad-hoc imports | Continuous or automated partner feeds |

## Embedded Importers

### What it is
- In-app import experience powered by the React SDK
- Validates and transforms data client-side before sending

### When to use
- Product-led import UX inside your app
- One-off or occasional imports initiated by users

### How it works
1. Render the importer in your app
2. Map/validate fields and preview results
3. Submit to your backend to persist/process
