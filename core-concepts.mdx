## Overview

FileFeed streamlines file-based integrations through two primary paths:

- **Embedded Importers**: In-app data import experiences (React SDK)
- **Automated Flows**: Backend/SFTP-driven automation with webhooks and API

## Building Blocks

### Clients
- Represents a data source (partner, vendor, tenant)
- Has dedicated SFTP space and credentials
- Isolated from other clients

### Schemas
- Define expected structure and validation rules
- Ensure incoming files conform to your target model

### Pipelines
- Connect a client to a schema
- Define mappings and optional transformations
- Create dedicated SFTP folders for uploads

### Pipeline Runs
- Each processed file creates a pipeline run
- Expose status, metadata, and processed data retrieval

### Webhooks
- Notify your system about pipeline events
- Sign payloads for security (HMAC)

<Note>
Use webhooks to trigger data syncs. Use the REST API/SDK to fetch full processed data.

## Next Steps

- **Frontend**: Start with the React SDK → `/embedded-importers/react-sdk`
- **Backend**: Set up SFTP and webhooks → `/automated-flows/sftp-setup`
- **Programmatic**: Use the API Library → `/api-library/overview`
