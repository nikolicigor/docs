## Local Docs
- Dev server not running → run `mint update` then `mint dev`
- 404 pages → ensure you're in the folder with a valid `docs.json`

## Webhooks
- 401 Invalid signature → verify HMAC with correct secret
- Timeouts → respond within 5s and process async

## SFTP
- Connection refused → verify host, username, password, IP allowlist
- Empty folder → ensure file uploaded to pipeline-specific directory

<Note>
Check server logs and webhook delivery logs for detailed errors.
